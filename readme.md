# Twibot! The friendly discord bot

## Features

1. Twitter link replacer

The bot detects whenever a user sends a twitter link in the chat and will either replace the message with an xcancel url, or extract any animated media at the source. The bot is also set up to parse batch link posting, though the upper limit has not been tested.
