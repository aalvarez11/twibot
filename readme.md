# Twibot! The friendly discord bot

A discord bot that will hopefully evolve and grow, with new features for use in my discord servers.

## Dependencies

- [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [dot env](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
- [vxtwitter API](https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix/blob/main/api.md)
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
- [pytest-asyncio](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-asyncio/)

## Features

1. Twitter Link Replacer

The bot detects whenever a user sends a twitter link in the chat and will either replace the message with an xcancel url, or extract any animated media at the source. The bot is also set up to parse batch link posting, though the upper limit has not been tested.

2. Delete User Messages with a Reaction

The bot detects when a user reacts to a message with a designated emoji, in our case ‚ùå (unicode value: U0000274C), and as long as the reactor is the initial author, the bot shall delete the message. There is potential for moderation in the future, expanding the criteria to a moderator role being able to delete a message.

3. Roll Dice

## Future Plans

- [ ] Add dice rolling for xdy format
- [ ] Add dice rolling using FFG's Fate Dice System
- [ ] Use the future [xcancel API](https://github.com/unixfox/nitter-fork) for video embedding
- [ ] Pray for in-house Discord video embedding (and in discord py)
- [ ] Separate twitter logic into functions
- [x] Add message deletion for user's own messages via emoji reaction
